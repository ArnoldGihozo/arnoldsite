# Welcome

Thank you for visiting my website. On here, you will find a description past and current
projects that I am working on. You will also find my work experience, volunteer and other
aspects that are portraying to my work.

I am always looking for new ways to get involved into a new project! If you are looking for a collaboration, please reach out through \[contact page] and I will be more than happy
to follow up with you.

Until then, please stay safe and keep on coding!

Yours truly,

Arnold Gihozo
