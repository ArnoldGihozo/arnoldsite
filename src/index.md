I am currently in my final year of computing science at the University of Alberta. Through the past 4 years I have been at ualberta, I have accomplished many projects. One of my passion is working in making a change within my community. I have worked with various organizations to bring Computer Science curriculems to high school and junio-high schools around Edmonton. I have also worked in creating events and compaigns promoting the culture diversity that we have on campus.

Outside my advocacy work, I have been working in using my tech skills in making a change. I firmly believe that developing goes more than just code. As developers, we work into making a change within our environemtn whether we realize it or not. With that said, I have worked on various project such as Open Door project (git hub repo bellow) to improve the day-to-day tasks of the organization. Furthermore, I have worked on mobile application such as Mench PintSize application aiming to improve blood donations within the Albertan community.

Outside school and work, I enjoy playing music in various Edmonton community bands and sing in local choirs. I am an avid music enthusiat, loving music ranging from classical to Afrobeats/pop and jazz ðŸŽ¶. In my free time, I enjoy sharpening my programming skills and working on small projects relating to the work I am passion in.

## My Current Focus
- Currently, I am working in building a music recommendation application aiming to give people the opportunity to discover music outside their known genre.
- Continue the work with Pint Size project
- Continue the work with SupportShip application
- Finishing my undergraduate degree
- Contribute in open source projects
- Learning new skills and languages (Go, Rust)
